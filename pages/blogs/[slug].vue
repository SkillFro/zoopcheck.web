Behavioral questions become especially invaluable when an employer is deciding between the top few candidates left.",

This could be a change in environment, responsibilities, or ad hoc challenges. Certain positions might also require a great deal of interaction with clients, or sometimes challenging situations with other employees. Sample questions under this umbrella may include, “Can you tell me about an instance where you had to defuse a sticky situation?” or “Describe a time when a major change took place at a previous job and how you handled it?”",

One’s ability to work well with others is crucial for almost any position out there. Teamwork questions are the most common type of behavioral interview questions. The answers you provide can inform your future employer about your strengths, weaknesses and ability to lead. A general question may be, “Tell me about an experience on as part of a team that you found rewarding.” For a higher-level management position, a sample question may be, “Can you share an example of a time you stepped up to a leadership role?”",
